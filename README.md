A set of images is provided (an example set is available in the `resources` folder in sources code https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oMmv8YUy1ex_R3daggoIZu7aJSoQngcP).  
The program recognizes which cards are lying on the table (only in the center of the image).  
For example, in the image `10c3s2d.png`, the cards on the table are 10c, 3s, and 2d.

To run the program, you need to pass the full path to the folder containing the images as an argument.
